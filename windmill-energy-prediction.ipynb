    "Energy can be produced from wind using windmills. Choosing a site for a wind farm (i.e. the location of the windmills), however, can be a multi-million dollar gamble. If wind is inadequate at the site, then the energy produced over the lifetime of the wind farm can be much less than the cost of building the operation. Hence, accurate prediction of wind speed at a candidate site can be an important component in the decision to build or not to build. Since energy produced varies as the square of the wind speed, even small errors in prediction can have serious consequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "One possible solution to help predict wind speed at a candidate site is to use wind speed at a nearby reference site. A reference site is a nearby location where the wind speed is already being monitored and should, theoretically, be similar to the candidate site. Using information from the reference site will allow windmill companies to know the wind speed at the candidate site without going through a costly data collection period, if the reference site is a good predictor.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Windmill data set contains measurements of wind speed (in meters per second m/s) at a **candidate site (CSpd) (column 1)** and at an accompanying **reference site (RSpd) (column 2)** for 1,116 areas. Download the Windmill.txt file from Canvas, and put it in the same folder as this R Markdown file."
